## 📋 Project Overview

FootKick is a fully responsive, single-page e-commerce application for premium football equipment. It was built as a multi-phase frontend project demonstrating professional React development patterns — from basic component design through to global state management, custom hooks, protected routes, and a complete multi-step checkout experience.

Users can browse a catalogue of 12 real products across four categories, filter and search in real time, view detailed product pages, manage a shopping cart, and complete a two-step checkout — with authentication required before payment.

The application includes a full site structure with navigable pages for About Us, FAQ, Shipping Policy, Returns, Careers, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service — all styled to match the dark theme.

## 📐 Development Phases

This project was built incrementally across 7 structured phases:

| Phase | Goal | Key Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | Project Setup & Layout | Vite setup, Header/Footer, `useState` page switching |
| **Phase 2** | Page Components | ProductList, ProductDetail, Cart, Checkout components |
| **Phase 3** | Redux State Management | Store with `productsSlice`, `cartSlice`, `authSlice` |
| **Phase 4** | Hooks & Side Effects | `useFetchProducts` (useEffect), `useCart` (custom hook) |
| **Phase 5** | User Authentication | Login/Register forms, checkout auth guard |
| **Phase 6** | Testing & Debugging | Full user flow tested, console warnings resolved |
| **Phase 7** | Documentation & Submission | README, code comments, organised repository |

## 🧠 State Management

Redux Toolkit manages three slices of global state:

```
Redux Store
├── products
│   ├── items[]          — full product catalogue (loaded via useEffect)
│   ├── selectedProduct  — product currently viewed in detail
│   ├── filter           — active category filter ('all' | 'jerseys' | ...)
│   ├── searchQuery      — live search string
│   └── isLoading        — true while simulated API fetch is in-flight
├── cart
│   └── items[]          — { product, quantity, selectedSize }
└── auth
    ├── user             — { name, email } of logged-in user
    ├── isAuthenticated  — boolean gate for checkout access
    └── error            — login/register error message
```

---

## 🪝 Custom Hooks

### `useFetchProducts`
Simulates loading the product catalogue from a remote API. On mount it dispatches `setLoading(true)`, waits 800 ms, then dispatches `loadProducts` with the full catalogue — making the loading spinner visible on every fresh page load.

### `useCart`
Encapsulates all cart calculations and dispatch calls. Returns `{ items, totalItems, subtotal, shipping, tax, total, add, remove, update, clear }` so any component can interact with the cart without touching Redux directly.
